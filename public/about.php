    <h2>
        I am John Morrison a Washington State native that retired in Rio Rico, Arizona.  
        Over the years, I've built houses from the ground up, held an electrical journeyman card and ran my own electrical contractor outfit.
    <br>
    <br>
        After retiring I got bored of sitting around and doing nothing, so I decided to start The Handy Gringo!
        I offer my services as a non-licenced contractor but I promise you honest dependable work at a reasonable price.
    <br>

    <h3><u>I also enjoy being a part of the community.</u></h3>
